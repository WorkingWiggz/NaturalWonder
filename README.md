# Natural Wonder

A *All-in-One* D&D app focused on providing you with what you need to jump straight into any D&D session, so all you would need to do is organise when you want to play it. 

## Why this app?

Traditional D&D can need paper to write notes, character sheets to be created and managed and a boat load of dice to roll to determine out comes. You also need to know how to play and what the various terms and rules of play are, which is where Natural Wonder comes in. The app is broken up into four sections: Look up, Dice Rolling, Session notes and Character Sheets. Each one focuses on one of these four aspects of D&D so all you would need to bring is your imagination.

## **Look Up**

Rules are the bread and butter of D&D with you needing to at least understand or learn how the game works in order to enjoy it. This section helps with that allowing users to browse a number of topics and features of the game, also allowing users to look up what specific items do and their descriptions allowing when playing to create a more immersive experience all round. After all, you can't *accidentally* turn someone's cow into a zombie cow unless you do your homework on that kind of thing. 

## **Dice Rolling**

Did I say rules are bread and butter, well I was wrong, you can't play D&D with out 'em, they are the very life blood of the game and are the very exciting part about playing it, one bad roll or several and that could be it but on the flipside singular great role and you could achieve your wildest dreams. While I can try my best to match the feel of rolling physical dice, I fear my app comes short on that aspect for now. On the other hand, you'll find that I've matched the *goblin-esque* feel of dice hoarding allowing you roll as many dice as you wish to roll at once and if your recovering from math rock addiction it also has a section dedicated simpler less colourful rolling.

## **Session Notes**

I don't know who brought up butter but something that is as critical to D&D as butter is to toast is the need to keep track of everything that went on. It's a timeless story, you play D&D you have a great time, the session ends on a cliff hanger and then weeks pass and you have no idea why your stabbing a merman in the basement of a tavern but you have a vague feeling Dodgy Dave put you up to it. You need to have somewhere to keep your key notes of each session and that's exactly what this section provides allowing you to keep track of what ever happens in a session, so that if Dave inevitably betrays you in an session, it won't stay in that session.

## **Character Sheets**

Forget about bread and/or butter for a moment. Character Sheets are what D&D is about, embodying a role entirely created by you. Be they good, bad, looking for that nice comfy wiggle room or sir-stabs-a-lot, they are the character you will play as either for that entire campaign or their life comes to an end with both of those options resulting directly from your actions. This section allows for the creation and maintenance of character sheets directly in app allowing you to check critical information at an ease while easily being able to add equipment, spells, and levels to your character.
